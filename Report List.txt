Report: I woke up late last night from a bad dream. I decided to get some fresh air in the backyard, and I was outside for about 20 minutes before I heard a noise I had heard before about two weeks before this and three weeks before that. I know it was the sound of digging, and it was coming from the direction of my neighbor's yard. He has a privacy fence so that I couldn't see much. I don't get to speak to the man much because he works night shifts. I know he does some gardening, but I just don't see him ever doing any during the day much. Maybe that's what he is doing now, but no, it seems strange; the wind was blowing in my direction that night, and it had a foul stench to it.

Report: My friend Mrs. Morrison has been acting kind of strange for the past few weeks. She won't come out and see her other friends or me anymore. She doesn't even tend the garden or anything else. When I went to make a surprise visit a few days ago, I heard her arguing with her husband. He left the house shortly afterward. Whenever I try to reach her, I think she deliberately ignores me. Could you follow up on that, please? I'm afraid something's wrong, especially since she seems to be buying a lot of alcohol lately.

Report: My ex-wife is refusing to respect the terms of my restraining order. I've seen her standing on the sidewalk outside my apartment four out of five nights in the past week. I told her to leave me alone over the phone, and today, she left a photo of me in my car inside my mailbox.

POLICE_REPORT:	Responding to a domestic disturbance reported by Farah Josef Scott. According to Mr Scott, spouse Amelie Scott-Linter began threatening Mr Scott with violence during a heated argument.

Mrs Scott-Linter initially resisted instructions to drop the knife but soon cooperated and was determined to be heavily intoxicated. Mr Scott was given first aid at the scene and was taken to the hospital by a neighbour, Mr John Riley.

Report: Returning from a late night at work, I heard loud metal music coming from his house for the second time this week. It seemed odd, considering it was a weeknight, and I know he and his lady both have work in the morning around 8 am. I couldn't see a single light on inside the house, which made it more suspicious. Not sure what someone would be doing listening to music that loud in the dark.

POLICE_REPORT:	The above listed defendant Humphrey Breen and victim Deborah Breen have been married for fourteen years and have no children in common. On August, 13, 2009, the victim called 911 due to the fact that she and the defendant had a domestic altercation.

Report: I am Caleb's ex-girlfriend from years ago. I am writing this report because he would not stop stalking me. I was near where he lived, and he's always on the streets, following, taking photos on his phone. Please get the little creep off my back, I've tried multiple times to tell him to back off, but he ignores me every time. I think he can get arrested and put in jail if he does this again, the creepy weirdo. You should report him for me, anonymously, so he doesn't come to me for revenge. Thanks.

Report: At around 5:30 PM, I went to drop off some stuff for Mick. I usually drop it off at the same time every week, but I was running 30 minutes late, and when he answered the door, the house reeked. It smelt like old-lady perfume and lemon cleaner but a trillion times more potent. He was acting way more jittery than usual, but he didn't seem too bothered that I was late. Dude is very punctual, so that was also a red flag. He just took his stuff and slammed the door in my face. On my way out, I found what looked like a bullet casing in the grass but turned out to be the cap from a lipstick thing. It seems weird since the guy isn't married, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a girlfriend.

Report: I was on the job, fixing up Mr. Branden Simpson's PC that he had brought in the day before. He specifically asked us not to delete any files on his computer as they were work-related. When we booted up the PC, there were many folders containing pictures of battered and abused-looking women in them. Branden runs a modeling agency, but the photos were all poor quality and looked like they could've been taken secretly. It could be something serious, but Branden is well-respected, and I've never seen him as anything but a successful businessman. You'd think if Branden had any malicious intent he would have removed/hid the photos before bringing the PC into our shop, so I'm really not sure what to do here.

Report: Allan parked in front of Murphy's Medical Research and Free Clinic about 15 minutes before the place shut down for the day. He watched the staff leave for a moment and then seemed to call a technician over to his vehicle. The two spoke briefly before the man walked away to his own car, looking a little uncomfortable. As he walked away, Allan smashed an unlabeled bottle of liquid on the ground, shouted at the technician about 'expensive ingredients,' then pulled out and sped away from the clinic very quickly and most definitely over the speed limit.

Report: So, um, that hitchhiker that went missing last week? Yeah, I saw him hop into a car a few nights ago. A pretty recognizable car, it had one of those family set stickers on the back window--swear there were like, 6 or 7 kids and two parents, legit insane--and a ton of "live laugh love" kind of bumper stickers on it. Very soccer mom-esque, if you catch my drift. I saw the lady pull up next to the guy on my way down exit ramp off the expressway, but it was kind of hard to see since it was dark out. I'd recognize that neon yellow backpack anywhere, though. The hitchhiker was getting into the back as I was driving along, and I managed to catch a glimpse of the lady. Brown, curly hair, on the heavier side, middle-aged. She was grinning like a cat. Freaky. I peeled off before she could turn around and see me, but I can't stop thinking about that damn backpack. Soon as I saw the news, I came right here.

Report: There's this chick who keeps popping up on my porch. It's the strangest thing--she's rail-thin and somewhat tall, dark hair, kind of sickly-looking, so it just makes it all the freakier. The first time I saw her sitting on the front steps, I figured, whatever it's probably some random kid--then the second time, she's looking into my windows, eyes wide open, just staring. The third time, she's standing by my front door with something cradled in her hands, whispering some weird shit to herself. She ran off when my wife turned on the porch light, but now we're scared of what she might do next time she pops up. We have a kid at home, you know!

Report: I went to the store to get a pack of cigarettes, and on my way back, I saw this big guy checking around my neighbor's car. He was messing around with the back right tire, and I saw him pull something out of his pocket, but I had no idea what it was. He just looked suspicious, you know? I approached the guy. He got defensive and kept asking me what I was looking for. I didn't want to cause any trouble with him, so I walked off. As I was walking away, I saw him pull out his phone and call someone.

POLICE_REPORT:	On May 5th, at approximately 8:15PM Jose Bridges was caught snooping around the car of a staff member of Barnabas Bagels & Lox. When approached by security he tried to take off what seemed to be a GPS tracker from the underside of the vehicle. The staff member later reported that she saw the man a few times while not working and that she saw him taking pictures of her as well.

Report: My cat has been missing for a few days, so I hung up posters all over the street. During that time, I ran into Mrs. Jones, who told me that she had not seen my Little John for quite some time either, even though he used to play in her garden all the time. Tonight, I woke up to a deafening meow that sounded like my Little John. Something about Mrs. Jones feels off lately as if she has a dark aura or something. I saw her paintings. They are all red, almost like blood. She is obsessed with that color.  I know she moved in only a month ago, but could you please investigate this?

Report: After a problem with our security system at the morgue I sent the corrupted drives to a data recovery agency to hopefully restore the footage. I have some suspicions that Mark was the culprit behind why the footage got damaged. I don't have any evidence to go off, other than he was the only person working at the morgue that night. I'd like to get to the bottom of this without having to wait the 2 weeks it's supposed to take the recovery agency to return the drives. They notified me as well that the process isn't even guaranteed to restore the footage to a viewable resolution. I'd like to put my mind at ease and know for sure what happened that night.

Report: My long-time neighbor Mr. Winter came by for a visit a few days ago. I didn't want to be rude, so I let him in, although I was doing homework with my son. Anyway, I noticed something odd when I saw the looks the man gave my son. I dismissed it as a crazy notion and even let the man help him with his homework. So far, so good, but yesterday he approached my 12-year-old son outside his school and offered to take him home. Fortunately, my son refused, but this fact robbed me of sleep for the whole night. Mr. Winter is usually a nice and helpful man. He also told me that his hobby (video games) has a lot to do with teenagers and that he "knows what makes them tick." I don't feel comfortable anymore with the thought of letting my boy out alone.

POLICE_REPORT:	Mr. Winter was spotted as he was trying to hand a parcel of heroin to a 13-year-old boy. The suspect stated that the boy lived only a few houses away from him and that he thought the package was the child's brothers (the front runner in an infamous local garage band). We contacted the parents of the boy to corroborate Mr. Winter's story. The parents told us that Mr. Winter had tried to convince the local children in the neighborhood multiple times, to run drugs for him across town. At that moment, Mr. Winter was quickly arrested for attempted drug smuggling and coercing a minor into illegal acts. When we told him of the charges that were to be pressed against him, he devolved into hysterics. He said that "all this bullshit doesn't matter anyway" because he "is going to leave the neighborhood." The suspect was taken to the police station, where fingerprints and DNA were obtained for any future incidents.

Report: I was coming in from taking out the trash and thought I saw my neighbor across the street pushing something into her cellar. I know she has a dog that's quite the energetic pup, so maybe it slipped out and she was having trouble wrangling it to go back inside. She had the lights off so it was hard to tell what was going on over there. I know the dog is kind of big and she's somewhat of a small mousey chick, but whatever it was appeared to be giving her a pretty hard time. Eventually she got it and herself back inside the house and slammed the door closed. I called it a night there and went to bed not fully sure about what I saw.

POLICE_REPORT:	Police were called out by neighbors for suspect's aggressive behavior (throwing punches and scratching) and verbal threats. After talking with them, it was discovered that this was a recurring pattern and that the suspect had threatened their son physically for trespassing on his property, although a report for this was never filed. The suspect was taken into custody for disturbing the peace and assault and sentenced to community service and two years of mandatory counseling.

Report: I was watching a horror movie in my home when I heard screaming coming from the house over. I paused the movie and looked out my window to try and see what was going on at Jason's house. I noticed a couple extra cars in front of his home and in his driveway. The screaming had stopped so I chalked it up to crazy party antics or something and continued watching my movie. A few minutes later the screams came back, but much louder this time and not playful in the slightest. More like something from a slasher horror film similar to the one I was watching. I could swear they weren't coming from my speakers, but rather from his house. Anyway when I looked out the window again I saw some red substance splattered across the inside of his living room window. I was close to calling the police, but a few moments later I saw everyone calmly leave the house and enter their cars as if nothing happened inside. I'm unsure if I was just scared from the movie I was watching and drew a rash conclusion that something similar was happening next door or if I was a partial witness to something terrible.

Report: Went to pick up my kids from school and saw someone hanging around outside the parent pick-up area. I'm not sure if they were new to the system in place or what. Waiting for my kids to collect their things , I watched the woman sit in her car staring at the other kids as they came out. Not the strangest behavior considering that's what most parents are doing. The strange part was that she started yelling into the crowd of kids, almost as if she didn't know who she was picking up from school. The kids that eventually went over looked unsure if they should enter the car, but ultimately did. Getting picked up and not having to take the bus is considered a luxury that most kids look forward to. Why were these kids not excited and standoffish to get into the car with this woman? It made me feel uneasy watching what could have been something malicious happen and do nothing in the moment, so now I'm here to make sure this message is shared.

Report: I went to go see a doctor for a toe infection earlier today, and after revealing to him that I didn't have insurance he referred me to a "Doctor W." This supposed doctor seems to work out of his home, but I didn't think much of it. I go in, and this tall man greets me with the coldest expression. He takes me down to what looks like a basement with a whole setup, like, perfect for a surgeon; freaked me out. It looked like it belonged in a hospital, not some guy's basement. I asked him if he specialized in infections, and he said yeah, I specialize in a lot of things. He said something like, 'You need something removed, so I'll remove it.' The way he said it made me crazy tense. Inching my way towards the exit I said, "Hey, you know what? Nevermind, I'm sure it'll go away soon enough." He looked mad at me for wasting his time, but after a minute, his expression normalized. He told me to get out, so I did. I told my best friend about it--he works as a nurse over at Grand Pine Hospital--and he said it sounded an awful lot like this so-called doctor was a Dr. Bailey. Whether or not this guy has an actual license or whatever to practice medicine I don't know. The whole thing was suspicious. Figured I should do my civic duty and tell someone.

Report: I heard a loud noise that came from the alley behind McMurphy's Bar. Looking down the alley I noticed a man walking away quickly. The poor lighting in the alley made it hard for me to tell if there was a person laying on the ground or it was just some of the trash the bar put out for pickup. I know some of the homeless like to pick through the bags for cans and such, but I didn't see any movement back there. I went into the bar and told the bartender what I heard, he went out back to take a look. When he returned he told me he didn't see anyone back there, and that usually the homeless came by later when the bar was closing to collect the most recyclables.

Report: Listen, I don't even want to be here, but my wife insisted. My kid goes to John Hughes Secondary School; she's in the 9th grade and all that stuff. She came home two nights ago after her theater club rehearsal saying that one of her teachers was cutting a classmates arm and filling up jars with their blood. Now, listen, she's always told crazy stuff for attention, but this takes the cake. She's saying that the teacher that just got that Best Teacher of the Year award, Joseph Chase, was the one that did it. The same guy whose face has been plastered in the newspaper for the last few days? Can you believe it? Somehow she's got my wife convinced, but if you knew the tales my daughter has stirred up these past few years, you'd think the same as me. Make of it what you will.

Report: At around 11 PM, I went to get something from my car. This woman was standing in front of my neighbor's house with a flashlight. She was peeking around near the windows of the house. As soon as she noticed me watching, she turned off the flashlight and waved. I've never seen her before, but she walked off before I could approach her. I told my neighbor to check around where the lady had been, and he didn't find anything unusual.

POLICE_REPORT:	The plumber that worked for Idleman & Cook Plumbing Co. entered Ms. Wyman's residence around 9:30 a.m. for a scheduled repair. When leading the plumber down to the leak, Ms. Wyman began to make ominous comments towards the plumber. She then backed the man into a corner with a switchblade and threatened to kill him if he didn't comply with her demands. According to the plumber, he managed to push Ms. Wyman out of the way before hastily exiting the residence. Ms. Wyman chased the plumber out of her house and two houses down the street; this was corroborated by two eyewitnesses who were leaving their homes during lunch. When police showed up at Ms. Wyman's residence, she complied with law enforcement and was taken into custody. A restraining order was placed against Ms. Wyman by the plumber, Shawn B. Sage, and further evidence was found to charge Ms. Wyman for assault and battery.

Report: I saw a dog that looked like it was in terrible shape lying down in my neighbor's driveway. It was whimpering. I ran over to check on it, and Mr. Ruiz, the owner, came out to get the dog. It's the first I've ever spoken to the man. He was wearing sun shades so I couldn't see his eyes. He told me the dog was on her last days and was taking her to the vet very soon. When he picked the dog up, 'Maggie,' he called her; she seemed afraid of him. He assured me she's just very old rescue that's afraid of strangers. He has several dogs. I can see them playing in his backyard, and they seem happy. I'd like to take his word that I was the reason Maggie was skittish, but this poor animal seemed outright terrified to be touched by this man.

Report: Strange men are living in Tammy's house nowadays, and I only ever get a decent look at them late at night: tattoos, weird hair, and tattered clothes. Frequently the place has been changing from a quiet God-loving home during the day to a blaring punk rock garage concert at night. I have a feeling that these men are taking advantage of Tammy and squatting in her home and there's nothing she can do about it. It just doesn't add up why the place has nearly polar opposite people staying inside the same home. Like there's no way that dynamic would be sought out for. When I spoke to her about these late-night men and the loud music coming from her garage, she played it off like it was something that I imagined. I'm not sure if that's her old age talking or if she's afraid to confirm my suspicions that something wrong is happening here.

Report: Coming back from getting a late-night snack, I passed through the park on my way home. I had my headphones in but could see a couple of guys hanging around at the picnic tables. I recognized one of them as a personal trainer from Fitness Planet, he turned around and made eye contact, so I waved. He came running up to me away from his friends in a hurry, so I asked if everything was alright. He got defensive and kept asking me why anything would be wrong. His general demeanor made me more interested in whatever was going on over by the picnic tables. However, he kept moving in front of me like he was trying to give his buddies time to hide something I wasn't supposed to see. I left the park not sure of his intentions or what they were doing, but I had a strong feeling that something wasn't right.

I hear him weeping loudly in the house as if he wants everyone to hear. Last week he put up this gaudy memorial shrine of his wife Emily in the middle of his lawn with fake flowers, candles, and tinsel. I'm pretty sure I saw a scantily dressed woman follow him into his house late last night. I heard noises that sounded a lot like loud sex, but I can't be sure it wasn't that phony crying he's been doing. It's gross and creepy, whatever is happening.

POLICE_REPORT:	Officer Perkins arrived on the scene with myself, Officer Lutz, at 10:15 PM to a 911 call on 1804 Whiteman St. I requested backup due to the undecided nature of the call. When Officer Perkins and I arrived at the scene, the street was deserted. After checking the perimeter, we proceeded around back by the alley between Whiteman and 11th. There was a lone sedan (white) with the engine cut off. The vehicle was swaying back and forth, indicating a possible struggle.

Officer Perkins shone her flashlight into the back passenger window resulting in a male shout and the vehicle subsiding its movement. I moved to cover the driver's side of the vehicle, shining my own flashlight into the window. Mr. Keenan was seen by both officers with his hands inside the prostitutes chest cavity. He removed himself from the prostitute without the threat of force, but a station issued weapon was held in position as Mr. Keenan exited the vehicle. I assisted the woman out of the vehicle and immediately radioed for paramedics. The victim appeared to be unresponsive.

Mr. Keenan did not resist arrest and was polite during booking. The victim was later pronounced dead for over 48 hours by EMTs. 

Charges of Mutilation, Desecration of a Corpse, Solicitation of a Prostitute, and Illegal Parking are to be charged against Mr. Keenan.

I saw that Marielle was the one triggering the alert as she sneaked out of her house for the past three nights between 2-3AM. Marielle has a husband and a newborn daughter, so I get the late night diaper run that can happen. The frequency is the thing that peaks my interest. I know her husband is out of town on business currently, maybe she's fooling around with some other guy. But what about her baby, I didn't see her bringing her child with her on the cameras. Who leaves their newborn home alone to get their rocks off in the middle of the night? I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's reckless endangerment of a child. I plan on going to the police if I catch her doing it again.

Report: I met this guy--never told me his name--at the club last night. My friends and I decided to go get some drinks at the bar, after half an hour or so of dancing, and that's when I ran into him. He was friendly to all of us, but it seemed like he got bored pretty quickly since we weren't paying him much mind. Still, I was interested, so I was kind of just eyeballing him the whole night, hoping to get his attention. Eventually, he found this one girl and kind of just schmoozed her all night. I was kind of hoping he'd get rid of her, but no dice. My friends and I headed out just as they did, so I watched as the two turned the corner, and then all I hear was a scream coming from that direction. Of course, there was still quite a line outside the club, so it was loud, and no one was paying attention, but I know what I heard. I broke off from my group to see what happened, but when I got there, all I saw was a shoe. One of the heels the girl was wearing. The two were nowhere to be seen. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I've heard the stories about girls disappearing at night clubs; this could be one of those cases.

Asked him if he was going on a trip or something and he said, "he needed some time apart from Isabella" and that he was going to a hotel for a week till things cooled down. This past triathlon of arguments must have really done a number on Alex's psyche to make him not feel safe in his own home. Kinda makes you think if the threat on his life was serious.

POLICE_REPORT:	At 01:10 on 12/24/2002 a neighbor Mindy Klima called in reporting a possible burglary at 4761 Hope St. claiming they saw a suspicious person inside the dwelling on the top floor using a flashlight. Klima reported that the family was away on vacation at the time, and that the house should've been empty of persons.

Upon arriving on scene at 01:19 Officer Lauren Taylor #8823 reported that the front door of the dwelling was ajar. Officer Taylor awaited backup before searching the premises. I Officer Michael Torres #8612 arrived on scene at 01:21 and it was at this time I and Officer Taylor searched the property for a suspect. Moving towards the house, Taylor went around the back and I came up to the front door that was ajar. It was clear at this time that the front door showed signs of a forced entry, so I made my presence known as I yelled, "Police". I then entered the domicile and cleared the lower level area, apart from the debris created in the forced entry that occurred earlier there were no signs of a burglary. I radioed to Taylor that I would be heading upstairs to search that area, at which point Taylor entered the domicile and began searching the basement. Checking the second level of the domicile I found a disheveled bedroom with a bunch of clothes that were thrown out of a dresser and closet. Upon further inspection I noticed multiple empty jewelry boxes that were upside down and bare. Moving into the bedroom closet I found a floor safe that was scratched and dented by a tool of some kind. Those attempts appeared unsuccessful as the safe was still locked at the time of investigation.

The rest of the top floor appeared untouched, I reconvened with Taylor on the first floor where she reported that the basement was clear and untouched as well. It was at this point that we called for a search in the area for a suspected burglar. Taylor and I both returned to our respective squad cars and began searching the immediate area for the suspect.

It was at 01:43 that dispatch updated our search with a lead on a suspicious person in the backyard of 482 Wildwood Ave which was in the immediate area of the burglary at 4761 Hope St. Arriving on scene the homeowner at 482 Wildwood Ave said that the suspicious person was hiding behind their shed in the backyard. I and Officer Taylor made our way into the backyard after making our presence known by shouting, "Police". We went straight towards the shed and found a male wearing dark clothing laying on the ground. We detained the person at that time for being a potential suspect in the investigation. Upon searching the suspect we found a lock pick kit in their back left pocket. The suspect was identified as David McNamara by the drivers license that was in his wallet. Officer Taylor was searching the area for the missing jewelry and heard radio chatter coming from the woods between 4710 Hope St. and 403 Wildwood Ave. This alerted her to the location of the backpack which contained various rings, chains, and other jewelry inside as well as a radio device that was set to the frequency to hear police radio communications.

It was at this point that I arrested the suspect identified as David McNamara for burglary in the second degree, possession of burglar's tools, and unlawful possession of radio devices.

She has a dark Fonda Civil, and has a fondness for the home too, because I swear she had been driving by the house maybe once a week, just cruising by. For what? No idea. Night of the fire, I see the same car again parked out front. I look around, but I can't see if anyone's inside the car. I take a quick glance at the house across the street and don't notice anything out of the ordinary either and go to bed. Then, boom, a few hours later, I wake up to the sound of fire trucks and police galore. Oh and that dark Fonda Civil, yea nowhere to be seen.

POLICE_REPORT:	On October 8th, a home belonging to Gerald Holmes was set on fire. Approximately an hour after the arrival of firefighters, authorities found suspect Martin sitting in her car with an empty gas canister. The fire resulted in no deaths as the home was empty at the time, but due to suspicious behavior, the suspect was apprehended. Arresting cops noted that Martin was very apologetic and in near tears, claiming "it was an accident."

Report: So, I work for a demolition company, and recently I was tasked with cleaning out an old abandoned service building for demolition. A guy was lurking out in front of it, acting somewhat weird and shifty. He saw me walk up and asked me if I needed something. I told him I was about to clear out the building with my crew, and he got slightly nervous. He made me wait while he got something from inside. When he came back out, he had a big black bag. Whatever was inside of it was pretty heavy. The guy was struggling to haul it away. There was nothing else of interest inside the building, though.

It's been an "I can watch your house for you while you're away," "if you need a sitter for a date night, let me know," etc. I have a funny feeling about someone who wants to push themselves into your life with good deeds. Today she came by knocking on my door to tell me I should go out since it's been over a week since I did anything apart from work. I know I live close to the lady, but why am I being monitored on what I do in my spare time. I'm only reporting this because of her unwarranted persistence, otherwise, this would just be a good neighbor helping out a single parent.

She blocked his account, but he just makes another and does the same. I told her months ago this was a great way to process her feelings, but now it's doing more harm than good. The most recent comment he left was alarming. I don't want to repeat it here, but I almost called the police.

Report: I saw some guy burning clothing in an empty lot near the park late at night. The smells coming from the fire wasn't just from the clothes burning though, it smelled weird and not like anything I've ever smelt before. I sat and watched him for maybe 5 minutes until he dumped a lot of gasoline on the fire. I got freaked out by that and left. In the morning, I went to the same spot, but I couldn't really make out anything left behind. It was all ash. The weird smell was still there, though.

When I got there the officers just laughed at me and said they only reported real crimes and if she was just saying things on the phone and in passing, it wasn't enough to waste their time in writing up a report on her. Rosana has even gone to the lengths to harass my new girlfriend through texts. The last time we spoke she said something bad was going to happen to me if we didn't get back together. Which I am definitely not doing. If the police can't help me maybe making this report myself will.

POLICE_REPORT:	Officers were dispatched to John Hughes Secondary School to break up a physical altercation between 17-year-old Rosana Abedi and 16-year-old Melinda Stanley. Altercation appeared to have been started due to both girls showing interest in the same young man. Stanley alleges that Abedi threatened her life before advancing on her physically. Stanley was not seriously injured aside from bruising around her eye and a cut on her lip. Abedi appeared unscathed.

Report: I was house sitting for my friend this week and as I pulled up to make my regular check on the house I noticed that the outside motion lights didn't turn on. I left the headlights from my car on and took a flashlight in hand. I went inside to see if the breaker was tripped. As I made my way into the garage where the breaker is located I could swear I heard someone open and close the front door. I ran back upstairs to the front and caught a glimpse of a man as he ran down the street. I suspected someone took advantage of the opportunity at hand since the house was vacant, and robbed the place. I immediately called the police and when they arrived we looked over the house to see if anything was stolen or out of place, and it didn't appear so. After sleeping on what happened it dawned on me that the supposed burglar would have had to be pretty dumb to pass by my car with the lights on and expect no one to be inside the house. So maybe the person was inside the entire time and just left when they had an opportunity to do so. When the officer and I looked over the house, nothing was broken, and I even had to unlock the front door to get in. I haven't been able to get in touch with my friend who owns the house, but maybe she was letting someone else crash there while she was gone and forgot to tell me. Until I know for sure I'm passing this info along in case this guy tries to enter someone else's home.

POLICE_REPORT:	Responding to a call made by a bartender at Beau's Bar, two officers arrived at the scene at approximately 20:09, where bar owner (Frederick) claimed that his location's alarm system had been set off. A brief inspection of the premises showed that the bar had indeed been broken into (cash box was confirmed empty, and several liquor bottles had fallen from the shelves behind the main bar), which was backed up with security cameras. Security also demonstrated that the suspect had not left the premises, and had been hiding in the bathroom. Before he could run out, and after a brief altercation, officers Ulrich and Quentin were able to apprehend the 18-year-old suspect (Leon), who was clearly inebriated. The suspect then admitted that he had been purposefully waiting for the victim, intending to cause him some form of harm. Suspect was found with a pistol tucked into his waistband, missing two bullets.

Report: I found out about a model agency recruiter, Fletcher, through social media, but a friend of mine stopped me before I reached out. Something about a lot of these agencies were fake and I should be cautious about what I signed up for. I didn't think much of it and decided to reach out anyway.

Fletcher's very professional, very sharp. Said I had the looks, and she'd put out the word about me if I agreed to do a shoot in Berlin. I was like, whoa, Berlin? A little too far, you know? I asked her more about it, and she said it was an all-expenses-paid trip, and that they would be doing shoots with me for three weeks to cover their Fall catalogue. I continued to ask her more questions about what the job entailed and that's when things turned for the worst. She said there were plenty of other much more beautiful girls in her list that would jump at the opportunity and if I didn't want the job I needed to tell her immediately. I ended the conversation there and followed up with my friend if she knew people were told anything similar, and she said yes, almost word for word. When they reach Berlin, or Moscow, or Paris, they don't come back after three weeks like they say. She said she's known one girl who's been taken practically all around the globe, but never allowed to come home.

Report: I feel wrong doing this, honestly. I know Ms. Haugh works tirelessly to take care of her sick father and all, but lately, she's been acting a touch strange. Maybe it's the stress of it all, who knows. Her father used to hire some of the neighborhood boys to mow the lawn since he couldn't--lousy back and all--right? Ms. Haugh decided to continue the tradition, it seems. She works as a florist, you see, prettiest flowers in the neighborhood. The first boy she hired was my son, Nicolas. Nico went over, mowed the lawn, and accidentally stepped on one of her flower beds. Honest accident, my Nico would never be malicious on purpose. Ms. Haugh had been watching him, and when he stepped on the flower bed, he told me it was like she flew right next to him. Her face changed into something truly evil, he said, and for a second, he thought she was going to hurt him with her garden shears. She said he wasn't the first she'd hurt, but before she could attack, he ran off. My poor baby ran home crying. I mean, that has to warrant some investigation, right? Not only did she threaten to hurt my son, but she's hurt other boys before. She's always been a real sweetheart, but everyone knows she has a touchy temper.

I was super drunk, and everything was a little bit blurry. But I swore I saw a woman talking while dragging a large bag, and shoved it in the back of her van. I could see the pack moving and making noises as they violently slammed the door shut. I was sure it would have awoken half the neighborhood, but they quickly got in the van and drove away. I'm not accusing anybody, but she did sound like Beth Hensely from down the street.

Mr. Hardy has always been pretty much a pushover with his students.

The weird thing was he ushered this 19-year-old looking girl into his office by putting his hand on her ass. Definitely not an appropriate action from a teacher who's practically three times the age of any of his students.

Report: I happened to run into Mr. Garvey today while walking in the woods. We spoke briefly, and for some reason, he was covered in blood. It looked so scary. I can't describe it. He explained to me that he had just shot a deer. He described the deer as a "big fat ugly bitch" who, according to him, "couldn't even run from obesity." I know that he lost his hunting license a few months ago, but I was just too afraid to ask. And he had this funny look in his eyes. Nobody knows much about him, and all this just won't let me go. I was never very good at describing what is wrong with people, but believe me when I say that there is something wrong with this person.

POLICE_REPORT:	A 911 call dispatched myself, Officer Sloane, and Officer Adams to Mr. Garvey's house on suspicion that he was holding and torturing a neighborhood dog. When we entered the suspect's home, he confessed to eating the dog and burying the remaining carcass in the garden with an old suitcase. The only reason he gave was "I want to try everything once" and wanted us to know that he had treated the animal well, and gave it a quick death before eating it. The owner is going through with compensation charges, and the county has gone through with charges of animal abuse, animal torture, and the illegal slaughter of an animal for the purposes of consumption or trade.

Report: I walked into the bathroom at Club Krive and found a woman bent over the sink scrubbing what looked like blood out of a rag. In her concentration she mustn't have heard me enter the bathroom cause she kept murmuring "I can't be seen with this." Sitting in a stall I started to get anxious about whether or not it was a good idea to leave with this strange lady a few feet between me and the exit. In those dreaded few minutes I heard another voice that wasn't the woman at the sink. Some kind of groaning coming from the other end of the bathroom. I'm not sure if something happened before I entered the bathroom between the two women, but it was down right frightening enough to make me forget about having to go to the bathroom. It seemed like an eternity, but it was probably only a few minutes before some more women came into the bathroom. After which I successfully made my escape in that moment and didn't look back.

He went up and shoved him out of the way and continued down the road. I never saw anything so bizarre. I think it was that man up the road, Mr. Winkler. He always seemed so happy - what a nutty way to start a day.

When he answered it, he was sweaty and red, and it looked like there was a scratch on his neck he was trying to hide from me. I asked him if everything was okay or if I should call the police, he interrupted me there and said, "Everything is perfectly fine" and there was nothing to worry about. I tried asking what all the screaming was from and he just said it was "private" and nothing he needed to share to me. Fingers crossed that this is just a one time thing and I'm not stuck next to some psycho couple for the rest of my time in this neighborhood.

She's been married to her new husband, Mr. Abbot, for a little over two months now. I talked to her sometime this past week, and she was going on and on about how smitten she was being a newlywed. Happy for her I didn't want to ruin the conversation, but noticing the makeup wrinkling from her large smile I had to say something. I asked her if she was trying to hide a bruise around eye. She got embarrassed after realizing that her makeup wasn't covering it. She told me it was just some stupid accident, nothing to worry about. I could tell she wanted me to drop it so I did. I'd hate to think the sound the other night was the same interaction that caused her to get that bruise. I hope everything is okay, I really like the Abbot's.

Report: I saw a couple of joggers I've never seen in this area before buy from the ice cream truck that frequents this area. They chatted with the driver for a minute and got some cups of ice cream, but it also looked like the driver slipped them both a small piece of paper or so it looked like. The two joggers both went in opposite directions on the sidewalk. I found this a little odd. I've never bought anything from the driver. He always smiles and waves at me as he drives by. However, I've never seen him do that before, let alone two people jogging together to then just split up after buying ice cream. I think the driver lives nearby.

This man and a teenaged companion entered my station a few minutes ago from a car with two other people inside. They purchased several snacks and paid for the car's gasoline, along with a 12 pack of beer. The man appeared to be of suitable age to buy alcohol, but to be safe; I checked his ID - sure enough, he was 27 years old, which surprised me, but I guess some people are just lucky to have faces five years younger than their birth certificates. However, when the man and the teenager left the station, I saw them both pick off a can of beer from the pack and start to drink them. Buying alcohol for a minor is a blatant crime, and this man must be taught a lesson for endangering that teenager.

Report: I'm work friends with Priscilla Sanchez, recently she got out of the hospital and has been working from home until she's strong enough to make the commute again. Wanting to surprise her and check in on how she was doing, I purchased a small care package and went over to drop it off. When I got to her place I rang the doorbell and waited for Priscilla to answer. When she opened the door I noticed some heavy makeup around her eye, shocked that this poor lady couldn't catch a break. I asked what happened. She shrugged it off as nothing, just her having trouble getting used to using crutches around the house. She accepted the gift with a smile, but quickly ushered me away. Saying that her husband was coming home from work soon and I needed to leave before he got back. While her story is believable that she hurt herself using crutches, why'd she need to rush me off her property? I can't imagine her husband Nico would find people coming by to wish his wife a speedy recovery a bad thing.

Report: I have reason to believe this girl working at the mall is a prostitute. Wendy is what the boys call her, she works at Tight Gossip, the store that sells all those weird clothes the goths and freaks wear. I swear to Jesus I've never seen someone with so many piercings able to actually hold down a job before. I tried to investigate if all the employees who work there wore the same revealing clothing she had on or if there was some employee uniform. She was rude and very passive-aggressive as she answered me. She said I was just jealous that I didn't look as good as she did and I was taking out my anger on her for that reason. Little does she know I've been watching multiple boys come into the store, not to buy anything, but rather to get her number. She's giving it our to practically anyone that comes into the store and asks for it. Makes sense that someone making minimum wage is so happy with the job they have. She's working a second job racking in the tips as she whores herself out to any passerby who gives a hoot. I want the mall to be a cleaner, safe area, where I don't have to worry what happens after dropping my kids off. If we let this slide who knows what's bound to pop up at the mall next, drugs, illegal gambling, gun trading. It's time to take action, let's keep the mall a crime free zone.

Report: This man poisoned my dog with cocaine! I walk my dogs every day at the park near my house, and I use to see this man walking an old lab until a few weeks ago. That dog was a real nuisance, running around like a wild animal and digging holes under all the trees. Yesterday, I saw him there again on his own with a jar of cocaine, and he was high off his ass. He was stumbling around, his face was all gross and sweaty, and he was throwing that coke around the trees like a farmer sows seeds! I guess he thought he was trying to plant a cocaine tree or something. My dog, Barkley, must've recognized him and approached him, no matter what I did to try and stop him. The man closed and put down the jar and started getting seriously touchy with Barkley. It looked like he was trying to eat my dog! His hands were covered in cocaine, and as soon as I could, I grabbed Barkley and carried him off. He's been sneezing non-stop since I got home, and his eyes are all red.

Report: This Friday, I heard rumors that the lady who was responsible for seriously injuring sixth-grader Blake Hannity in a hit and run was Tanya Carter. Word is they got security footage that showed the license plates, but they came back to a vehicle of an entirely different make and model. The minimal description of vehicle used in the incident somewhat matches up to the car Tanya drives. What makes the rumor somewhat more credible is that I haven't seen Tanya driving her car since about the time the accident occurred. She's been using a rental to get to and from work and told me her car was in the shop for a failed brake line. Blake's mother will tell you that Blake was an upstanding member of his class with many friends, but my kid has told me before that he was a bit of a bully at school. I know Tanya has a boy around Blake's age, I wonder if Blake was messing with her kid.

Report: I went out with my brother to Golden Ale Taproom, and he got real friendly with a woman he met there. I kept an eye on Pat because he gets a little wild when he gets some booze in him. They were having a blast on the dance floor together, Pat was showing me a side of him I never saw before. Spinning the woman around, going for dips, the whole lot, would've assumed he was a pro if I didn't know. She came back to the bar to take a break and told Pat she wanted to go outside for some fresh air. Pat took her outside and I watched them talk and smoke a cigarette. When he came back, he said the woman went home in a taxi, but I didn't see anyone pull up through the front window. Pat was flexing his hand a lot as if he hurt it. I asked him what happened to his hand and he said it was from some work thing and the dancing must of irritated it. He left pretty quickly after that. I don't know what happened, but it's not like I was going to judge him for leaving to try and get some.

POLICE_REPORT:	Responding to a call placed by Isabella Medina reporting threat of death by her husband, Patrick 'Pat' Medina, reported under the guise of ordering a pizza over the phone. Upon arrival, a handgun was found in Mr Medina's possession, and a sweep of the house found a further two weapons (a 12-gauge shotgun and a hunting rifle) on the property; all three weapons were purchased legally by Mr Medina, but were not kept under appropriate measures of safety and security. Mr Medina cooperated with police but continued to shout abusive remarks at Mrs Medina, as well as threats of violence and grievous harm. Armed officers arrested Mr Medina and took Mrs Medina and their two children into protective custody. Mr Medina was kept in holding for the night and released the next morning.

A couple times a night random cars will pull into her driveway. Whoever's in there just walks up to the door, goes in, and comes back out a few minutes later and drives off. I don't know, it just seems suspicious to me.

I got an invitation from a friend a few weeks ago to go to a poker game. When I got there the atmosphere was off. It looked like everyone at the table already knew they were gonna run me dry before I even sat down and that's damn well what happened. Now I'm in a tough spot, a guy with that kind of money definitely has connections all over. Going to the police isn't an option, without giving someone at the station my personal details they won't do anything with my anonymous tip. I hope you guys can help me instead, please if this guy stays free on the streets I don't know what will happen to me.

Report: So at about 3:30 today, I saw someone in H. Fineman's jewelry outlet that looked like my old friend from high school, Theresa Hayes. I wanted to say hi, but I saw she was busy talking to one of the people there. She was trying on a big fancy-looking ring, diamonds on the band, the whole nine yards. Anyway, I overheard her saying that the ring was too small, and the saleswoman went into the back to get a ring sizer. I could've sworn I saw Theresa swap the ring with another one she had on her. When the saleswoman came back with the sizer she played along, but ended up leaving without buying anything. I saw the woman who worked there put away what I think was the fake ring. I walked out after Theresa to talk. We stood outside the store for about 5 minutes and then went our own ways. Surely if you just stole something from a store you wouldn't just wait around the scene of the crime to get caught, right?

The dog's name is Bruno; he's some sort of terrier or spaniel or something. I sometimes hear that dog howling at night, sometimes for hours at a time, and it sounds very much like it's scared or in pain. I love dogs, and I know it'd just kill me if I stood by and let a cruel and heartless owner potentially harm one.

I've seen this man walking his dog around the usual spots nearly ten times in the past three weeks as if he's coming out precisely when I do. Whenever his dog... you know, he takes several minutes cleaning it off, wrapping it neatly, then hiding it in his coat pocket. Some of the staff at the Kennel have even seen him cleaning off and taking other dogs' business. His dog is big, too, and aggressive. I know he's not done anything illegal as of yet, but I saw him talking to a kid the other day while they were walking their dog, and I just got a bad feeling.

Report: I think this woman could be a child kidnapper or something! I saw her at the park with two children whose mother I personally know. I went up to her, introduced myself and asked the kids where their mother was. The attitude of this lady was just ridiculous, she looked at me with this resting bitch face and said, "Yea hey, I'm Latoya." Almost instantly after she got defensive and said, "I'm babysitting them," "I just calmed them down, I don't need you getting them all worked up again asking for their mother." Appalled at her knee jerk reaction to my innocent small talk, I stood there in shock for a couple seconds. Breaking the silence the kids cried, "I wanna go home!" Clearly fed up with me the woman carried one child and commanded the other to go back home like they asked. I tried getting in touch with their mother Michele, but I haven't heard back. I'm pretty close with Michele so it surprised me to see them with a lady I didn't know. I'd like to think if the kids were scared or in danger they would've ran over to me for safety. I really don't know what to do other than report this here while I wait for a text back.

They were all drunk, whooping and singing, pushing each other around, tripping each other, and then they started doing some real damage. One of them keyed a random car and jumped around on the hood while the others laughed. Then one of them, in particular, threw a big rock straight through my front window!! Scared my dog half to death! I charged outside to confront them, and they all just ran away, yelling curse words at me. The man who threw the rock, in particular, made sure to call me out from halfway down the street, the coward. I didn't get a great look at him, but I remember his build and haircut. I want to press charges and sue him for damages to my house and any trauma my dog has experienced!

If I go report this to the police I have a feeling that they'll just brush it off as a false report on a hard working officer by a citizen who has a grudge. I can't share my source, but as of late, I know she's been missing afternoon appointments, taking case files home with her (which is very sketchy), and she's been demanding responsibility on anything to do with human trafficking cases in the area. Usually, I'd think she was just a workaholic, but this seems different. Like she wants control over the situation more than just curiosity.

I couldn't see him all too well cause it was so dark, but they were yelling at each other, and this guy just kept yelling, 'You stepping to me, you piece of shit? You stepping to me?' I don't know what that means, but the drunk man was just staggering around, he didn't seem like he was even aware of what was going to happen. Then this guy threw a fierce punch and sent him reeling! He collapsed on the sidewalk, hit his head on the concrete and was knocked out. The guy who punched him didn't even look back at what he did. He just walked off laughing, mimicking the punch he just threw at the poor man.

He always seems like a chill and friendly dude, but I saw him a few days ago up close, and he has flaky, almost scaly skin. He appeared to be in a trance and didn't even notice me. We usually chat for a few minutes, but he didn't seem up for it. While I'm concerned, the thing bothering me is what happened last night. He had one of his friends over, and they were chatting away having a good time. The next thing I knew, his friend was on the ground. Hernando seemed to laugh about it before dragging his friend inside his house.

He took photos of the license plates and the front door to the house. I watched him through my window as he stood outside, talking on his phone for over a minute. He was looking through the windows and the mail slot when, suddenly, he started yelling at somebody on the other end of the phone. He hung up, paced a bit on their porch, then got in his car and took off. The guy looked like some type of agent, a real proper type, interesting considering nothing ever happens in this small little town.

She told him she had a cat at home, and if he came with her, she'd see about giving him a job as a pet-sitter. She gave the boy a piece of paper, and the boy rode off on his bike. Honestly, the woman seemed creepy; she had a stare and a grimace I just can't get out of my mind. I saw where she lives, and the place is kind of run down. The paint on the house is chipping, and the grass is overgrown. It just screams, "spooky."

She seemed very confident and relieved speaking about these things, until she turned around and saw me behind her. She quickly changed direction and continued her phone call out of ear shot. I'd like to think I don't look disturbing to the point where a mere glance in my general direction would drive someone to essentially run away. On the other hand maybe it was a secretive call not meant for strangers to listen in on. Reporting this now it sounds less odd than I thought it was when I saw it first hand, just take my word it was weird.

Report: I saw this guy walking with these two girls with his arms around both of them, but not in that casual ladies man type of way that's relaxed. More of a tighter hold, like he didn't want them too far away from him. As I got close enough I said hello in passing, he answered, but when one of the girls responded he scorned her. I turned around confused about what just happened and the girls looked back at me with this freaked out face. This only seemed to make him more angry as he pulled them tighter and began walking faster down the road. I've known plenty of guys that are over protective of their girlfriends, but a simple hello shouldn't even be a blip on their over protective radar. Even more so when you're lucky enough to have score two girls and they're both smoking hot. The guy was way too big for me to even consider saying something, but I didn't like the way he was treating those girls.

So part of me believes that I walked in at the perfect time to validate one of the worst conclusions. I'm not going to go ahead and forward this to the school board without finding more information about what happened.

When I brought it up to her she acted like it was the first time she heard about it. She played it off as being tired from work and that we'd sit down for coffee another time to go over it. I know Hayden pretty well and she despises coffee. I guess it could've just been a figure of speech, and that she didn't actually mean she would get coffee herself. My suspicion comes from the fact that I know she has an identical twin named Amelia, but I've never met her before. Even if that was Amelia and not Hayden why wouldn't she correct me when I clearly called her Hayden multiple times?

I know most seniors have a cut day where they all go out to the beach or the woods together to party. Maybe today was senior cut day and he was afraid I was going to rat him out to his mom, because after he saw me he started running.

Report: My mates and I like to game in our spare time, and we have a Doscord server. Recently, this girl called Dae, who lives in our town, gets invited into it. Oh boy, is she fucking annoying? She would not stop complaining over the smallest things. "Why am I playing with you guys? I'm ruining my KD ratio." "I'm hard carrying, y'all are so trash." It seemed she had some anger issues. Then one day, one of my friends, Aston, had enough of her bullshit and called her out on it. She proceeds to freak out calling Aston a dick and a bunch of other expletives. At the very end of her rant she said, "You have no clue who you're fucking with motherfucker. I could fucking kill you if I wanted to." After which we banned her from the server and thought nothing of it. The strange thing is we haven't heard from Aston in a couple weeks. He told us he was going on a vacation to see his friends from college. It's been a while since I or any of the other guys heard from him. I feel like people go on vacation for a week or so, but it's been about three weeks. If the trip was going to be thing long you'd think he'd have mentioned it before going offline.

POLICE_REPORT:	The police were called on 10-year-old Ms. Daeriel Thompson who was threatening her fellow students with a kitchen knife. She was quickly disarmed safely and nobody was harmed. The exact reason for Daeriel's actions was unknown. However, she is known to have anger issues among other personal problems. Daeriel is described as "Crazy and evil" by her classmates and "Troublesome" by her teacher, Mr. Walker. Considering her age, Daeriel was only ordered to attend anger management sessions, and no punishment was handed out.

Report: Travis Gray is my science teacher. Yesterday after school, he asked me to help lift some boxes of books from the office wing. So I went. We arrive at his desk, and I start lifting his stuff, which was pretty heavy. Halfway through it, I came back to see him hopping towards the nurse's office on one leg. I assume he twisted his ankle or something. I went in, got on with the lifting, and noticed his phone on the desk. I'm not one for snooping around, but it continuously buzzed, so I looked at the screen, and it showed messages from his wife. There was stuff like "I'm sorry, please forgive me." and "Our daughter wouldn't forgive you either if she knew about this." I got pretty concerned, but I didn't want to risk him coming back to his phone going off with suspicious messages while I was next to it, so I went on another run. When I came back, he had an ice pack to his ankle, and he was texting who I presume was his wife. He looked visibly angry and told me I did enough for the day and let me go.

Things like "you look great on your knees, sorting those files," and "even good women seem to be working late nights" as if to say I'm a nightwalker. However, a few days ago, while I was working late, he ordered me into his office and asked me if I wanted a bonus. He said if I was to work as his assistant from inside his office a couple of evenings a week I would be compensated time and half for the extra physical work. I refused, of course, but he completely lost his mind and fired me. He said if I tell anyone about this, he is going to kill me. I'm afraid of this guy, and I need someone to look into him.

Now, she doesn't seem to care for anything anymore, and only leaves the house to buy groceries. When I asked her what was wrong, she told me to "fuck off." that's not like Mrs. Martin at all to act like that. There has to be something very wrong going on with this woman. The only thing that seems out of place is this conspicuous vehicle that's been parking in front of her house as of recent.

Yesterday, I saw him talking to one of the boys from the neighborhood, perhaps trying to convert them as well so that his blasphemous cult can get more followers. Take this guy out of circulation!

I gave her my phone to use, but all she did was hold it up to her ear for a few moments then started typing in a bunch of stuff. The woman didn't appear to leave a message, and I couldn't find any proof she'd sent out a text either. Eventually, she finished up, thanked me, and I went about my day. Later on, the number that the woman supposedly called rang me late into the night. I let it go to voicemail, but no one left a message. It was weird, so I called it back, but nobody picked up. My phone has been running slow ever since, and no matter what I do, I can't get rid of this little black box in the top right-hand corner.

Then her boyfriend disappeared, and yesterday it all reached its climax when I spotted a strange guy standing in front of her door. I have to assume the boyfriend left after getting sick of putting up with her drug addiction. By the looks of her there's no way she can keep that figure without popping some pills on a daily basis if you ask me.

I let him inside my home, and when he was on his way out, he slowed down, stood still, and just started admiring things inside my house. I appreciated the compliment to my home decor and asked if he needed anything else before going on his way. He jokingly said, "Yea, toss me a key so I can come back anytime." I forced some laughter at the moment to be kind. I'm not sure if he perceived how I acted as an agreement to his ridiculous question, or I'm just forgetful on where I last placed my keys, but now I'm missing a set of keys from my key rack.

Report: I've noticed a strange man following a young woman home for the past week. Call it coincidence but this guy is always out walking really late around the neighborhood. It looks like he has one of those fit watches that tracks how many steps you take per day. I know it reminds you when you haven't met your exercise quota, could be why he's out walking when most people are inside for the night. The woman I saw last night entered her home and the man waited in the distance jogging in place talking into his watch. Reminded me of one of those secret agent spy movies, except when he talked into his watch the whole idea of that being cool looked so dumb. I know those things have a ton of features, but the timing was weird. I felt like he was taking notes on the woman's actions.

I yelled at him before he dropped from the tree and ran down the block around the corner. I've seen the kid around before, I don't know his name, but I remember catching him shooting one of those airsoft guns in the street. I lectured him that there were kids around here that could get hurt by a ricochet. He was very polite, apologized to me, and I haven't seen him doing that since. However, as he dropped down from the tree I could see the butt of a gun peeking out of the back of his waistband. I hope it was that stupid airsoft gun, I couldn't be sure though. They really do make those things look real, unless you see the orange tip on the front of the barrel.

POLICE_REPORT:	A distress call to our 911 dispatch alerted the county police department of death with suspected foul play. Upon arriving at the scene, it was evident based on the mannerisms of Kelly Huse that she was suspicious of what our Officers determined a homicide. The victim was pronounced dead by EMT, but first aid was not performed after Officer Warrens found no pulse on the victim. After an encounter with Ms. Huse that left myself and Officer Warrens with superficial cuts from a kitchen knife, the suspect was arrested. Due to the bizarre speech, hysterics and oddity she showed before our questions began, she is being submitted for a psyche evaluation pending trial.

Report: My neighbor is an older woman, and this evening I saw this kid in a hoodie walking around her house. I think he might have been casing it. He had his hand on something in his pocket that he wouldn't let go of. With his other hand he tried a few of the doors around the house to see if they were unlocked. After being unsuccessful in his efforts to enter the house he calmly walked off the property and drove away in his car. 6PM is pretty early to be breaking into someone's home considering it's still light out and about everyone is home eating dinner at that time. Without that thought I would've had a shadow of a doubt that this kid was up to any good snooping around her place.

I know he has a dog, but the sounds coming out of his house didn't match what I'd think a dog would make. After about an hour, I saw him bring the dog outside to go to the bathroom, and it had a noticeable limp. The dog laid down in the backyard and wouldn't get up like it didn't want to go back inside. He shouted for the dog to come back in the house and ended up having to pick it up to get it inside.

Report: I got a friend at my job named Stanley. We're both technicians, so our job usually requires us to go into houses to set stuff up for clients. All well and good, but Stanley and I decided to get drinks after work one night, and the guy had one too many drinks. Started blabbing about this one client, said he still had access to her cameras.. I thought he was pulling my chain so I called his bluff. The guy wasn't lying, all fourteen cameras are live playing on his phone. He maximizes one of them and low and behold there's a woman. My jaw hits the floor, she looks like she has no clue she's on camera as she's lying on her bed watching TV. Stanley is a pretty quirky guy, this could all be a practical joke on me, and it's just the cameras over at his place. This woman though, stunning beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous. Stanley on the other hand, not so much of a looker. Without much going on he put his phone away, but made an offer if I wanted to see the good stuff I could pay him for access. I laughed it off, said I'd think about it, and changed topics.

Report: I took a walk after dinner to clear my head, passing by one of the storm drains near the park during my trip. I could hear faint moaning coming from inside the storm drain, so I shouted, asking if someone was down there and needed help. I didn't get any response, but the moaning didn't stop. I took out my flashlight to inspect inside the drain. All I saw were some leaves and a small puddle of rainwater. Before I got up, I yelled again, this time much closer to the drain opening. This time what I think was a woman popped up with hair covering her face. She said, "Come down here, fatty, let's play," and then hobbled off into the darkness laughing. Thoroughly scared, I chalked it up to some of the kids playing a prank on me and jogged my ass home.

Sometimes I see him in his backyard wearing a full clown get-up--does he work as a clown? No fuckin' clue, we're not on speaking terms. The problem here, though, is that he likes to stare at my kids. Creep peers over the fence and all, just starin' at them as they run around. I've had to tell him once or twice to fuck off, but every time I do, the guy gives me the scariest look. One night, he broke into my yard in his full-on clown outfit, and my kids just ran up to him. Listen, he's breaking into my yard, trying to get my kid's attention all the time. You have to look into it before I take matters into my own hands!

POLICE_REPORT:	On September 10th, 2012, authorities were called to 38 Haven Ave (MacDonald residence) after receiving a frantic phone call from babysitter Francis Beauregard. The latter reported to have seen a "clown" in one of the house's bathrooms, but after her first encounter with the person, she ran out immediately to secure the children, only to find one of the four missing. Upon arriving, police searched inside and outside the home for any signs of an intruder. In the backyard, Henry MacDonald was found sitting across from a young man dressed in a clown suit. The suspect gave himself up willingly and the child was taken to a hospital for check-up, where doctors found several bruises and cuts on his arms. Suspect was detained and transported to central booking to be arraigned at a later date.

Report: Julie's a tenant of mine--she rents out one of the smaller houses that I own in the neighborhood. Terrific gal, pays on time, really pleasant to speak to, and not at all bad to look at, but some weird things have been happening lately at the house. Listen, I own the place technically, okay? Sometimes I wander in to make sure nothing's broken, sue me. More times than I can count, I've walked into pools of blood on the dining room table or the desk. Next day, clean. Sometimes I see Julie entering the house covered in bruises and cuts and the next day, gone. Sometimes, I see pieces of skin scattered over my coffee table and couch. The next day, it's like it was never there. I mean, what the fuck, right? I like the kid enough that I figured I should say something, just in case she's in real trouble. Also, don't want too much damage to the house in case it gets worse, y'know the drill.

Report: Fuckin' Dexter, man. Listen, he's my frat bro, okay? A total ladies man, a future doctor, honors student, all that good stuff. He's a good person, I'm sure of it. The other day, don't know if he was under the influence or what, but he just wasn't acting himself. He can be a smart ass sometimes, but he's normally manageable. We had our second rush of the year a few weeks ago, and this poor kid signed himself up. I'm talking freshman, maybe 5' 5" on a good day, 120 pounds soaking wet. The guys zero in on him, naturally, and do the usual hazing stuff, but Dexter and Ricky went too far. Well, more like Dexter went too far. I'm pretty fucking sure the man branded the poor kid with a hot poker. I saw the three head into one of our rooms, didn't even bother closing the door. Ricky manhandles the fuck out of the kid and tells Dexter to do it, but the guy hesitates, and then the door closes. I saw him holding the poker when the door opened, so he must've done it, right? The kid finally had enough, thank fuck, and took off running. I can't get it out of my head. It's one of the few things I remember from that night. I love the guy, really, but branding someone is crossing the line.

Report: I recently hired this DJ for my club. Hot off the underground scene and all; my guys and I figured she was ready for the big leagues. She's a weird one, though. I've had countless problems with her - she's aggressive, loud, erratic. I can't fire her cause she's brought in too many customers--she's good for business! Maybe she's on drugs, perhaps she's not, but she's dangerous. After she finished her set for the night, I saw her head into the VIP section at the back of the club with the same lowlife that I banned last month for dealing drugs on the dance floor. The two looked real chummy, let me tell you. That's not the wrong part, though. See, my club has strobe lights, and just as the lights hit them, I saw him take out a gun from inside his jacket and pass it to her. I mean, come on. I should've known that these underground folk were loose in the head. This fuckin' girl's already psychotic, she's friends with some scumbag drug dealer, and now she has a gun. That should be enough to warrant some investigation. And if she's guilty of being dirty it gives me a way to get rid of her without losing her entire crowd.

Report: The school district's been limiting itself to, like, one photography company for a few years now. There's a photographer on their roster that's been acting strange around the kids, though. Don't know his name, but he's an older man, tall, kind of has like, light brown eyes or something. Picture day just went down at the local elementary school, and the guy just kept touching the kids, making weird comments, smiling a little too much, a little too hard. The other teachers agreed with me: this guy can't be good. We've mentioned it to his company already, but beyond telling us he's among their best, they're moving slower than a snail. I have little doubt that this guy uses his job as a way to get to kids, and for everyone's sake, we need him gone sooner or later.

The sounds persisted for about 4 hours on and off, before things finally quieted down. As the group exited the residence a neighbor saw the woman wearing a hat and sunglasses as if to hide her identity or possibly even some marks that were created by the men inside the house. If there's one thing that gets me heated it's men who think it's okay to hit women. If what I think happened in fact did, I want those involved charged and I bet you would want the same.

Report: You ever meet someone and think, that's a serial killer? Yeah, I have, and her name's Max Snow. We're both students at the local uni, and we're in the same pre-med track, doing our anatomy class together, but we're not exactly close. Anyway, she's fucking weird. Awkward as shit always looks like she crawled out of bed 5 minutes before class. Like she's hiding a secret. I try to avoid her because of it, but the anatomy class has made it hard. She's so fucking weird about the bodies. She gets this look in her eyes that I get when someone puts a plate of cake in front of me. We got paired up to finally do a dissection - not on a human, but a cat. Baby steps, whatever. The whole time she was cutting the cat, she was just muttering something about "When can we do this on an actual body?" I'm here like, why so impatient? She says something about us not being vets, but it's horseshit, and we both know it. She cut the cat with ease and quickness that can only be explained by experience. She's cut shit before. Real things. After class, she told me she knew where to find the actual bodies, and asked if I wanted to join her. I was like yeah, fuck off, and came right here. She needs to be looked into ASAP.

Report: Heard the most frightening noise yesterday evening, it wasn't the cats fighting or the raccoon rumble that occasionally happens in the neighborhood. It was much too early for that, but it was undoubtedly some animal screams of bloody murder. The sounds stopped after maybe 5 minutes; I think whatever it was in a fight with won because it was silent for a while. A half an hour following the silence, I heard my neighbor's garbage cans get knocked over, prompting me to take a peek. I caught my neighbor G in a dirty apron dumping some kind of dark liquid into his garbage cans.

I don't think I've ever seen the guy without wearing some piece of camo, nor have we had a conversation where shooting doesn't come up somehow. He's kind of someone you can only tolerate in small doses, and I mean that as nicely as possible. Another night, we were sharing some beers on my porch and figured I'd ask him to tell me a story, the freakiest thing that's happened to him out there, or something. He's usually pretty friendly, jovial, you know? But I ask him that, and he shuts down. He says something like, "Nah, man, you don't wanna know." I prod him a little, hey, at this point, anyone would be curious. A little more convincing, and he says, "You run into more people out there than you'd think." What could that mean "You run into more people out there than you'd think." What if that was his weird, obscure, little way of getting the guilt off his chest for shooting someone? He's always said he's addicted to the adrenaline of hunting a hard target. Did hunting for all these years push his bounds for what was considered a hard target?

I hack too, but I'm nowhere near his league. Regardless, he asked on the forums the other day if anyone wanted to team up to practice doing some shit, I said hey, why not, so I signed myself up. We hop into a call on Doscord, and suddenly it goes from practicing shit to fucking hacking into a bank's security system. I noped out as soon as I heard that was the plan, but TRAILBLA3ER and the other five people working with him started talking about hacking into Chirpr next, for the hell of it. I'm pretty sure they were serious about it too! Now, listen, I know this guy is more than capable, but it's one thing to hack into low-tier shit for giggles and a whole nother level to hack into bank accounts and fuck around with people's livelihoods. I know for a fact he lives here, just don't know his name, nor what he looks like. Guys like him who give little to no fucks are the ones you must keep an eye on, trust me.

I mean, there's no confession, obviously, but she shared the address and everything, absolutely zero shame, and now people are saying that the chick who got doxxed wasn't her first victim. Weird, right? But also pretty shitty. I like her a lot, but I don't like that she does this. It's not right. I doubt she's just doxxing these chicks too - the recently-doxxed girl was just killed. Everyone thinks it's related to the fact that her location got leaked, and I think it's pretty evident that Dovey's to blame for it. Not saying she did the killing herself. I don't know; it's just too weird.

Report: My next-door neighbors are selling their house and were having an open house to help with the sale this Saturday. I caught one of them picking something up in the far corner of the backyard and stuffing it into their purse. I immediately ran over but came up empty, trying to find the person. I found one of the homeowners, Jeff, and filled him in on what just happened, and brought him to the spot where the woman picked something up. While both of us both were standing above freshly dug up soil, I said the item looked like a plastic freezer bag with something inside. He said he was shocked that he didn't even notice it happen. I asked him if he knew why there would be something buried in his backyard, and he shook his head no. I saw dirt under Jeff's fingernails, but given the previous denial of events, I didn't press him on it. I gave him a rough description of the woman, and he told me he'd check with the real estate agent to try and figure out if they signed in on the open house sheet. As I left, he continued to mingle with the potential buyers, rather than pursue finding the stranger who had just stolen something from his property.

When I asked him about it, he assured me that he was just "clumsy," and it was his fault. While that is a possibility considering he likes to skateboard around the neighborhood I'm reluctant to believe that's where all the bruises came from. See I know his father pretty well and he's a chronic drunk. I worked with him for a couple of months before he got fired for driving a bulldozer into a brick wall. Sometimes, he screams so loud at his son that I can hear every word he says. I've been quiet about this for far too long. In case this guy is half the piece of shit I suspect him of being I want him looked into. I'd like to get to the bottom of this rather than just going over there myself and handling things the old fashioned way.

Report: I've filed multiple noise complaints on Ms. Dang since she moved into her apartment in the Springdew Complex last month. She's been pretty liberal with following the rules around here, playing music into the odd hours of the night, having long chats with people till 4AM. It appears my complaints are going nowhere as my building manager Jared has a thing for her by the looks of it. I brought it up to Jared directly and he made it clear if I kept up this behavior he would be looking for a way to evict me. I have to imagine Ms. Dang paid this guy a favor behind closed doors, because prior to this Jared and I were on good terms. Jared is one of the most foul looking men I've ever seen with a hideously managed comb over he refuses to shave down. It doesn't add up why a gorgeous young woman like Ms. Dang would pay any mind to him, unless of course it was to have him look the other way from what she does inside her apartment.

She does an incredible amount of work to look good and probably drives one of the most expensive cars in the neighborhood. Last week there was some weird guy in a suit, about her age chatting with her on the porch. They were talking about whether Mrs. Hudson was prepared or not for the "intese stuff" and that next week, three men should come for the "final coating." I'm not comfortable with the idea of a criminal living next door to me!

Report: Mr. Tseng has been with his wife for quite some time now, I want to say close to 20 years. This evening a woman that I've never seen before entered Mr. Tseng's home when his wife was away. I think she is currently on a business trip, but don't quote me on that. Later in the evening, I heard a woman screaming and then a glass shatter coming from what I suspect was the open window in his home. I rang his doorbell, and after a minute of waiting he opened the door and greeted. He explained that a vase fell over after his friend accidentally bumped into it dashing away from a bug she saw. As he closed the door I could see a freshly dressed wound on his hand. Mr. Tseng is a smart man, why he would've withheld that information about his hand injury is beyond me. Call me skeptical, but if it did happen from the vase, why wouldn't he just say so?

Report: I had a new neighbor move in yesterday, and she's crazy. I thought at first, she was doing some light renovating/remodeling of the home, but she's just busting holes in walls tearing up floorboards. It sounds like a construction site, but it looks like it's just her without a demolition crew. I mean for crying out loud it's a new home. You think when she bought the place, it would have been her dream home. If she wasn't satisfied with the state of the residence, she should have kept house searching.

Report: I would like to file an official complaint against my neighbor. Every Friday night, every weekend, there's a party. The weekend is my time to relax. Maybe get something done around the house and end the day with an ice cold beer. But those days are long gone for me, now with this young lady and her parties I barely get any sleep. What twenty one year old even has the cash, let alone the credit to buy a house? I thought they said millennials aren't buying homes, what happened to that huh? I guess this one hit the jackpot scoring this place to herself. She just started extending the partying to the middle of the week too, I really hope this is just a phase cause I can't take much more. I need my 8 hours of sleep so I can function at work goddammit.

The other night Ken was in full form, totally blackout drunk and spewing nonsense about his ex. I tried to get a ride for him so he'd get home safe, I saw the car pull up, brought Ken to the car, said bye and returned to the bar. Maybe 20 minutes later I went back outside to smoke and hear a couple people describing someone that attacked these two girls. Their description matched up to what Ken looks like, I hope that horny motherfucker didn't do something stupid on his way out.

Report: There's been a white, rundown-looking van in Kenney's driveway since Sunday. It's leaking oil onto the sidewalk and smells like a restroom when I pass by it on my morning walks. I sent my husband, Harold, over to ask him to move the van since it's ruining the neighborhood's jogging route, but he didn't answer the door despite us knowing he's home. I can see him through the big bay window on the front of his house. I know he's in there, but he's not answering his phone, and the van is starting to stink to the end of the street. Even the Mulligan's can smell it.

I also heard from Lorraine that he's been working under the hood of the van late at night. I guess there's something wrong with it, and that's why he won't move it. Either way, it reeks to kingdom come. We all want it gone.

POLICE_REPORT:	Responded to an anonymous call from Fieldmain's Donut Studio about a disturbance in the middle of the road. According to several eyewitnesses, a Caucasian man was seen assaulting a Tow Truck Operator. The victim fled to the second floor of Nobil Parking Garage where he was assaulted with a tire iron by Kenneth Riley AKA Polly. 

Mr. Riley was incapacitated via nonlethal force and secured in handcuffs while my partner, Deputy Engelias, radioed for paramedics. The victim was breathing, but unconscious until paramedics arrived at 2:15 AM. Paramedics were able to treat the victim: a local Tow Truck Driver by the name of Angelo Ball. The hospital was contacted and informed of this victim's immediate condition and future admission. 

Mr. Ball appeared frightened, confused, and unwilling to press charges. Due to the violent nature and mandatory hospital treatment, Deputy Engelias and myself have drawn up the following charges: Attempted Murder, Assault, and Battery. 

Based on the language used by Mr. Riley after being read his rights, it is of the police force's opinion that Mr. Riley intended to take Mr. Ball's life.

Mr. Ball refused to give a statement.

Report: This one woman from the neighborhood has been following me for a few weeks. At first, I thought it was just my imagination and that it was all coincidence, but she's always shopping when I'm there or walking her dog while I'm jogging. The day before yesterday, I met her outside my school and asked her what she was up to. She told me that she wanted to pick up her son from school. I know better. She only has one son, and he's 13 years old, so he is too young for high school. I don't like the feeling that I'm always being watched by this lady wherever I go.

We were informed ahead of time about a fight in a bar near the apartment complex early where the suspect was spotted verbally lashing a white male. After arriving at the residence, we met with Mr. Connally. He appeared coherent but badly beaten and claimed his wife, Mrs. Connally, struck him several times with her fists then threatened him with a steak knife. As I approached the suspect, she charged at me with a knife, hitting my vest just below my middle rib on the left side. Officer Bates was able to apprehend her several seconds later. She was uncooperative during detainment, screaming at myself and the other officer that she was going to kill herself and that we should "shoot her dead." We handcuffed her and took her to the police station under charges of two counts attempted murder, including that of a police officer, domestic abuse and resisting arrest. Is it of the recommendation of this officer that she be admitted for a 72-hour psych evaluation.

Report: I went up to a yoga retreat in Ashwood Forest this past weekend and found the host Nathan to be quite the handsy man. The students that the teacher finds the most appealing (usually the young women) get all the attention. Whether it be a hand on their hip to make an adjustment, getting uncomfortably close to their face to softy say 'good job', or comments that would normally be disgusting are hidden under the guise of a revealing pose the instructor compliments you on. So come day two on the trip and I get creeped out and want nothing to really do with the host. I decide to take my time up there to practice on my own. I get up much earlier than the scheduled activities to have my peace and quiet to myself and notice two girls with their bags packed heading to the parking lot. As they pass by I ask why they're leaving and they say that the trip wasn't what they thought it was going to be and they felt weird staying after last night. Part of me was glad my views of Nathan were validated, but another part of me worried he did something to them.

POLICE_REPORT:	Mr. Crum was spotted rearranging soiled towels found 85 feet from an open crime scene. The towels were later confirmed to contain DNA evidence in relation to the crime scene. When approached by officers, Mr. Crum appeared to rotate between sobriety and intoxication. His behavior was deemed inappropriate by myself, Officer Charles Steinberg, Officer Manley, and Officer Cortez.

A warning was issued to Mr. Crum at 04:58. He expressed sincerity and embarrassment before leaving. Less than ten minutes later, he was spotted between two Maple trees near the West-side of the still-open crime scene. Near Mr. Crum, Officers found a woman's shoe (size 7 US) and approximately four broken, acrylic nails. He was detained after being read his rights and charges were issued. It is of this Officer's opinion that Mr. Crum is added to the list of suspects for the disappearance of Julijana Stolar.

I know the young kids these days do those dabs in the glass pipes or whatever. Joy never pegged me for a lowlife.

Report: I caught this strange guy walking into my neighbor's home. I walked down my driveway to confront him, since I knew my neighbors were still at work. He spun around before I got close and said, "Hey the name is Chip, I work for Sahara delivering packages. Customer requested I leave the package inside." Which sort of made sense, nowadays pretty much anyone can be delivering the things you buy online in an unmarked vehicle. The shady part comes later. I met up with my buddies for beer and wings and brought up the Chip guy. With a rough description one of the guys bring up a picture and it's totally Chip. He's laughing, but I can't figure out what's so funny. My buddy says, "His name isn't Chip it's Glenn Banks. Where the hell did you get Chip from?" I tell him that's what the guy introduced himself as, said he worked for Sahara and was delivering packages. My friend looked confused and told me he doubted Glenn worked for Sahara. A delivery gig like that usually went to the younger guys that could actually pump out numbers and get a bunch of stuff delivered quickly. He said Glenn was 58 and far past his young and spry age. The longer I thought about it, the more sense it made it me. So does that mean it was just coincidence that they had a package while this Glenn guy randomly stopped by and moved it inside their house? That sounds extremely unlikely and way less believable than the former.

He's always with a different woman, and they always go home with him. Maybe he's outstanding, but I don't ever see him get rejected. I asked for his secret, and he claims it's a mix of his charm and pleasant personality. Surely there's more to it than that. Tonight the woman who went home with him almost seemed a little too sleepy.

Report: My 9 year old daughter Missy didn't come home from school two days ago and I think my mother may be the one to blame. It's been a couple years since my mother and I have seen each other and apart from yearly birthday and holiday cards we don't speak. I'd like to think my own mother would have the human decency to not pull something like this. But ever since my dad passed away she's been trying to rekindle our relationship and become one big happy family again. My wife is dead set on keeping my mother out in the cold, and from our past that might be for the best. However in a situation like this it helps to know that your family is there for you and you can depend on them to tell you the truth. Upon making this report my wife has already contacted the police and filed a missing child report, but it makes sense to spread this message far and wide. I need my child home, thank you.

Report: I went to pick up my wife from pilates class when out of the corner of my eye I spotted this white van that looked really out of place for the area it was in. Walking inside the building I saw what looked like binoculars peek out from the driver side window. I hurried my wife to grab her things to confront whoever was inside the van for being a creep. When I came back outside I saw the van, and whoever was inside the van clearly saw me heading straight towards them. They peeled off fast enough where I forgot to check the license plate. However I know exactly what model van that is, I use one myself for my plumbing business. It's a Jyundai White 2003-2007 Van. I went back in and let the pilates class know and now you guys in the watch can be on the lookout too for this weirdo.

Report: I was babysitting my 9 year old niece recently and in her excitement to go to the park she ran out of the house without me. I grabbed my things and immediately ran after her, but couldn't find her. After what seemed like forever I found her hiding in the park. I was fuming mad, but as she ran up to me crying she said something about a strange man attacking a lady in a car. I tried to calm her down to figure out what happened. She said a lady was moving really slow and the man punched her leg with an orange thing. Then he looked up and saw my niece and said everything's going to be alright little girl, after which she ran out of there and found me. Thinking it was probably some kids fooling around in the backseat, I asked my niece where she saw this happen. She took me over to one of the parking lots, but said the car was gone.

Report: My son has been having nightmares where some evil woman comes into his room, sits, and watches him as he tries to sleep. He'll usually run into my room scared, or he'll end up wetting the bed in terror. I always try to assure him that it's nothing and that it'll go away, but just recently, he brought me something that has me reconsidering. My son handed me a piece of paper that had cursive writing on it that said, "I am real." It isn't my son's handwriting, it isn't mine, and it's not his babysitter's either. The night after that, I swore I heard his window slam shut. There was no one in his room or my house, but I've nailed the windows down, and he's been sleeping with me for the last few nights.

POLICE_REPORT:	The owner of the residence at 10th & Elk St. called about a woman walking around the side of his house. When the police arrived, the suspect was not found. Further searches of the area turned up empty. However, later in the night, a neighbor alerted 911 that a woman was seen in the window of the owner's house. The police were dispatched, and the suspect was finally apprehended. Lock picking tools, a camera, and a kitchen knife were found on their person. They were taken in on charges of breaking and entering, and trespassing with intent to harm.

Report: I saw Mrs. Collins at the grocery store, but I wasn't sure it was her until I got close. She was wearing sunglasses and this scarf thing inside the store. I asked, "Hey Mrs. Collins is that you?" She looked surprised that someone recognized her, but remembered who I was and made some light chit chat. I asked how she and her husband were doing, and she responded with this weird smirk on her face that she was taking care of him today. Mrs. Collins made a scene about needing to pay with cash after she clearly got in the line that said credit/debit only. She looked to me as if I was going to agree with her that the clerk was wrong and I looked away. She scoffed before turning around and talking shit about me under her breath. I found the whole interaction and the almost disguise she had on in the store to be a little offbeat.

Report: While I was giving my dogs an evening walk, I passed by David's house. I haven't seen him in upwards of two whole weeks, but before I turned down the street, I saw a black van with no windows pull into his drive. It dropped him off, then peeled out of the driveway like a bat out of hell. It was dark by that point, but I think I saw bruises all up and down his arms and legs, and he looked like he had barely enough energy to make it up the three steps to his front door.

Report: The so-called doctor Charlson has recently returned to town. I met him yesterday while I was shopping. He told me that he spent six months in Africa, helping with a reconstruction mission. But something seems rotten. Not only did he have his whole house completely renovated, but he also bought a new car and had the entire garden replotted. I'm no expert, but I am almost sure that you don't get that much money just because you work abroad for half a year. His lousy reputation around town gas given him the nickname "Butcher." I've known this man for quite a while now, and I can't imagine that he honestly got so much money.

Report: If you're not aware already Howard is a foley, who makes sound effects for mainly horror movies. He's very proud of his success, and boasts about it frequently. As such many of the sounds that come from his house, while they could be bloody screams of murder, most of the neighborhood has tuned out of the performance Howard puts on. It's believed that he recreates his films inside his home. Hell it's not even uncommon to walk outside hear this barrage of painful screams, only to see Howard casually walking outside to throw out the trash, sweaty, but happy as a clam. With the ordinary out of the way, here's what played with the curiosity switch in my head. What if this friendly, upbeat, giddy man, was just using this whole thing as a disguise for what was really going on inside his home. This past weekend the wind tipped over his garbage cans and I awoke in the morning to a sprinkling of bloody rags all over my front lawn and bushes. Now I should say I have no clue what Howard's performance entails. I don't know what's to be expected and what's strange. What I can say is that curiosity switch is flipped and for damn good reason too. I'm going to have my eye on Howard and I recommend the watch does the same.

My brother came back with the chainsaw, but he said the house looked fine except for a 'weird' smell, like metal shavings or wet dog. I can't recall if Vega has a dog or not. I never hear any barking. He's charming, but that was some creepy stuff my daughter said, and I figured better safe than sorry.

That bastard is the local dealer, and I think they got some shit going on between each other. My apartment has this pungent odor, so I have the hallway door open most days. The last time I saw the kid he was walking upstairs with Scott three days ago. To the best of my knowledge, that kid hasn't come down since. Scott is continuing to make a few trips here for his other clients I think. What I do know is you don't want to piss him off, fucking kid has a temper. I would be going to the police on this one, but around here if you get found out as a snitch it'll turn your life into a living hell.

Report: I'm a police officer, yesterday I got a tip about this guy Alexander Dostoyevsky saying he's involved in some organized crime ring. How he's involved I have no clue, the call ended before I could ask any questions. The problem I have is there's no chance in hell I'll be able to follow up on it. Currently the department's focused on where the stats are right now and that means there's no resources for an investigation like this in the budget. Knowing that our station can't follow it up and the tip is next to nothing so no other station would want a whack at it I'm passing it over to y'all. It doesn't matter how you find the information on this guy, if you can find something that gives us a time and place where we can catch him in the act of a crime, where we got the tip doesn't matter. More than likely the court will find the evidence you share with us as inadmissible, but anything illegal we find in his possession will put him behind bars and off the street.

Report: I am Lorenzo's 72-year-old mother. Lorenzo is a little strange and quite difficult to reason with. A few days ago, his wife Mary, Lorenzo, and I were on a camping trip, and Mary asked if Lorenzo could teach her how to swim. He kept putting it off. I told Lorenzo it would be a good idea to teach her considering they were planning to go fishing in a couple kayaks, but he disagreed. When Mary left with Lorenzo that was the last time I saw her alive. Paramedics found her unresponsive downstream from where they had gone fishing and were unable to resuscitate her. Lorenzo and I cried for hours on end the day that it happened. But now only a few days after, my son has grown cold to me. The few conversations I've had with him feel like and I hate to say it, but faking being heartbroken about the loss. I know people process grief all types of ways and I'm not sure if this is him just trying to be a man about the whole situation or his strange behavior is showing its face again.

Everybody ran, and Dylan hit his knee hard on the ground. I couldn't help him and hid in a shed. I hid for hours until my parents arrived with Dylan, and we went back home. I didn't tell my parents, and we didn't see Larry on the way back. I think Larry will come for revenge again, and I'm scared.

Report: Mike is a co-worker of mine. He is, well, an asshole. We work in insurance, and he's in some deep shit, it seems. Rumor has it that he was pretty smashed one night at the casino, probably high as well. His wife was drunk as well, although nowhere near as drunk as he was. He fumbled for his keys, and his wife repeatedly told him not to drive and snatched them from him, to which he reacted furiously. I heard he was recorded attacking his wife in his car until a security guard came by and ripped him out of the car and restrained him. Some people in the office have claimed to have seen the video, I personally haven't, but they say it's pretty bad. I heard Mike talking on the phone ordering someone to take the video down after it was posted on the internet. Regardless if the rumor is actually true, if a video gets out that looks like he assaulted his wife, whether it happened or not the guy is fucked. The way these social media clips gain traction is insane these days. Guilty until proven innocent, I like to say. Fortunately for him he's rich, and has his dad's money to fund him in preventing this potential smear campaign from ruining his life.

Where he dresses up like some stupid ghost thing and demands that people stop. Watching the news today I saw a headline about a crash that left a woman seriously injured after her car went off road and hit a tree. A part of me thinks this is Broadie's doing.

Report: I am Mr. Ben Germain's manager. Business at the art gallery was booming last month, but after we nearly sold our entire lot, word came out from our supplier that some of the paintings were virtually worthless fakes. I don't know how that information could have been leaked to the public. Only Ben, our supplier, and myself were aware of the situation. The recent couple days have been hell with clients calling non stop, demanding refunds, claiming legal action against us, saying what we did was fraud. If that wasn't enough, it appears that the leak is being used as a distraction. Last night Ben's daughter Rebecca was kidnapped on her way home from school. The first conclusion that anyone would draw is that it has something to do with the recent news about the fake paintings. Going off that suspicion the client with the most to lose is Liam Wright. We've already gone through all the proper channels to report this crime, but want to extend our reach to this system as well.

It's fantastic that she has such a gift; however, I read in the newspaper today that someone who I could swear was a former patient of hers had robbed a bank. My doubt comes from the fact that the guy in the paper had a different name than the patient I was thinking of. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I need to schedule myself for some sessions with Dr. Givens.

Report: Recently, I went to an audition for a singing role in a musical. The audition went great, except for this one judge that took an interest in me. It was a younger guy with a low, raspy voice. It seems he enjoyed my performance too much because he invited me back to his house for some private lessons. At the time, I didn't think it was all that weird. I didn't get a creepy vibe from him until I got to his studio, where he had me begin to sing in front of some odd-looking dolls. It was off-putting, but I went ahead and did it. While he took a bathroom break, I got bored enough to start checking the dolls out some more. The skin felt bizarre, more than impressively realistic, and on the throat area of one of them was an impression... like a door. I touched it, only for a mechanism to open and a pained whimper to echo out of the doll. I was so disturbed that I left the studio, called a Youber, and started typing this report out.

I didn't even know you could order something like that at the restaurant. If that wasn't strange enough, I saw him dig up some meat he buried in his backyard from what I imagine was some foreign meat aging process. When he peeled the package open the stench that came out sent me sprinting back into my house. How someone can muster the strength to not throw up in the presence of that thing, let alone find it enticing enough to consume whatever that blob of meat was bewilders me. Makes me think the guy isn't human or something, really creeped me out. I felt like I could hear him eating it with his mouth open as he made orgasmic noises like he had just fulfilled his craving. Whole thing really gave me the heebie-jeebies and I still have to live near the guy.

Report: The young Mr. Redcliff has inherited a fortune of money from his deceased father a few months prior. I watched Aidan grow up, and he was always quite the impulsive and fast-paced person. Still, he seemed to be spending little of that money until now and seems to be living a healthy life. At least I thought that until I met him yesterday night. It was already dark, and I still had to put my garbage cans outside. It looked like I surprised him because he looked like he was going to draw his pistol on me, but didn't when he recognized my face. Of course, he tried to talk his way out of it, saying that you can never be too safe around here. Who even carries a gun with them to take out garbage? That's the type of chore you send your kids to do.

Report: My neighbor, Mrs. Monroe, is a strange young woman. She bought a house here when she was just 23 years old and has lived alone next to me ever since. She seems friendly yet withdrawn. Mrs. Monroe is always at home and does not seem to have a job. And now I know why. Two days ago, I saw Mrs. Monroe receive a visit from two men. One of them had a suitcase in his hand, which opened up when it fell to the floor. It was full of cash! It seems I was the only one who saw it. It was like in one of those movies. Men in suits and maybe thousands of dollars. Something is not right there.

Report: My brother Oscar's been a little weird lately. About two years ago, his daughter killed herself. It was alleged to have happened because someone was blackmailing her with naked pictures. Around this time last year, Oscar was utterly unrecognizable. Dealing with the events the transpired and the lack thereof a conviction really sent him to some dark times. He's struggling with himself, and it hurts me to see him change into a completely different person. It appears that cycle is repeating itself as he just heard of a lead on the suspected person who allegedly blackmailed his late daughter. I'm afraid Oscar believes the justice system has failed him and might take it upon himself to handle the investigation on his own.

Report: While chilling outside the liquor store, I saw a man's car speeding down Kelley Rd then turn onto Sigley Ave. I watched as he ran a red light, nearly hit a person exiting their vehicle, and hopped a curb as he turned onto Sigley. Thankfully no one got hurt, but even after the near collision he continued moving at a high rate of speed. I think I could hear his tires screeching as he made another turn or two in the distance. What could possibly be going on where you disregard human life in your efforts to be on time to something by speeding. Seriously this guy could have killed someone going that fast, a car is basically a 2 ton bullet.

Report: I was on my front porch drinking with my buddies when we saw this freaky looking young man walking down Crooked Hill Rd. He was wearing some tattered clothes and had what looked like blood on his face and body. We buddy yelled, "What'd ya lose a fight tall guy?" He didn't say anything back to us,but he flipped us the bird. Trying to get more of a reaction one of my other friends said, "Oh did little pussy tall guy get his ass beat so bad he forgot how to talk?" This got the guys attention, he spun around and said something in a demonic voice that sounded like "Wanna die tonight fucker?" We all shut up pretty quick after the guy pulled that card from his sleeve. A little banter is one thing, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. This creepy possessed shit the guy pulled I think broke that rule. Whole thing killed the rest of the night for me and the gang.

Report: You know those large fish tanks like the ones an evil mastermind has in those movies. The kind where there's a stunning variety of fish, and as you admire the vibrant colors a shark comes by and sucks the enjoyment right out of the scene as it eats the cute one. Well that setup is basically in my neighbor's backyard. The guy owns an aquarium and I guess brought some of the fish home. The weird thing is that they're in his pool. The guy must know his stuff, but don't all pools have chlorine in them? That would have to be bad, possibly even deadly for the fish, right? While it may be a cool party decoration for your backyard, I feel weird not reporting this. The last thing we need to hear is one of our dogs or even a child falling into the pool and getting attacked by Van's fish.

Report: I called a subcontractor to get some work done on my house. I got call back a few hours later from a guy who said he was with the company and was up for the job. He asked for a key since my hours did not line up with his. On the day the work was supposed to be done I checked the cameras inside and outside my home. I watched him arrive, walk around, and ultimately do nothing to my house. He had a tool belt on, a trailer attached to his truck similar to the ones some contractors have, but alas nothing was fixed. I checked around when I got home and my spare key was back under the mat, and it looked like nothing was taken from my home. So maybe he thought he could get one over on me and just say he did the job and cash the check. The other weird thing was I called the subcontracting company and they have no record of a guy named "Ernie Douglas" in their employee system. I filed a police report and sent over the videos of him walking around my property and inside my home. I want to make sure nothing more is to happen other than me losing a couple hundred bucks on some scam artist I made a check out to cash for.

Apparently, the reason her grass has been less than ideal was that the unit was leaking, and the irrigation system was suffering. But alas, the reason I'm concerned is, while I was rethreading the galvanized piping, I heard muffled sounds coming from her attic. The stairwell wasn't too far away from the pump, maybe 12 feet at the most. 

I myself turned our attic into a rec center for the boys, so I thought perhaps she'd left a TV on up there, but when I stepped over to investigate Sylvia came back in with some lemonade. Her mood changed when she saw me standing beside the stairs. For the rest of the time that I was there, she just hovered between me and the stairs. She didn't say thanks, either.

More than one of them didn't even have plates on the vehicle, and I'm pretty sure he was arguing with one of the drivers while gesturing for him to get the car into his garage. He caught me onlooking the commotion and gave me this look that said go the fuck inside and mind your damn business. Which is exactly what I did, but I continued to watch from the comfort of my home. When everything settled he went to shake the driver's hand and the driver pulled his hand away. I squinted to see what was wrong with Devon's hands and they had an odd unnatural reddish hue to them.

Her husband is ill often, and her two children have always been sickly. Recently, I went over to her house to help clean up the place before a family reunion party of some sort, and I spied her medicine cabinet. Yes, it would make sense that a household as ill as hers would have an abundant supply, but there was stuff in there that didn't look like medicine. Big bins of powders and labels scratched off on tin cans. It didn't look right, and for some reason, she's the only healthy one in the whole household.

My mother interpreted this obscure statement as Zach getting his life together and finally becoming a contributing member of society again. She's viewing his current lack thereof communication as being busy with work or something. I called myself to check on him and his voicemail message is some weird satanic chanting in the background as he repeats, "June 11th" over and over for the 30 second duration of the voicemail. I need help making sure he's alright and hasn't fallen into some weird brainwashing from the culty forums and books he's been religiously reading.

He even tried to sell them to me at a third of the original price. Stuff like that just needs to be burned. Which got me thinking, why did he have clothes like that in the first place?

It ruined the rest of our experience because the theater was full, and my husband didn't want to move to the few empty seats at the front of the theatre. I had her hot, panting breath on the back of my neck for nearly an hour. By the end of the movie, she was practically growling. She tried to talk to us afterward by speaking in a raspy voice and making a horrific face, but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. It was like she was possessed or something.

Report: For the longest time this guy Hilton has been after one of the other boxers by the name of Jimmy who frequents the gym. There's been plenty of back and forth between the two of them over the past couple months, but nothing more than a couple words shared and it ends there. Unbeknownst to the rest of the gym, Jimmy has been hooking up with Hilton's sister. And to obviously get a reaction he brought her to the gym to make Hilton freak out, and that's exactly what happened. Hilton kept his cool, but made it known he wanted a fight with Jimmy. In an attempt to keep the peace the gym owner set it up. After things kicked off it looked like every punch Hilton threw had 10x the power of Jimmy's punches. The fight was looking very bad on Jimmy's side, but with his strong heart and desire to win the fight continued into round three. It was at that point the ref called the fight. Jimmy was in rough shape, half the gym went to celebrate with Hilton while the other half stuck around and helped Jimmy get to the hospital. The fight was a couple days ago, and tonight we found out that Jimmy passed away in the hospital from the injuries sustained during the fight. We all know the risks of getting into the ring, especially with someone who's trained before, but part of me thinks that Jimmy's luck didn't run out that night. I think Hilton pulled some shit behind the scenes to tilt the odds in his favor. Everyone's gloves were checked the whole thing was above board from the looks of it. I know the police will be looking into this, but I can't stand to think this shit was planned and Hilton might get away with it on a technicality.

Report: I am the dean at John Hughes Secondary School. George Brown is an electrician and recently did a job at our school, installing security cameras in our bathrooms. The reason we have cameras comes from an incident we had where there was a bomb found in one of the bathroom stalls. I have had an anonymous tip that he has included a backdoor in the system for himself to access; this could be disastrous if proven true. My doubt comes from the strict vetting process the school district has when it comes to hiring outside contractors for work in the school. With so many widely regarded excellent reviews on George, it doesn't match his history to do something like this. Please investigate it thoroughly if you can, thank you.

Report: Claire is a horse person. She likes them and goes to check on them every day. Recently, after her boyfriend broke up with her, she stopped for one day. Her boyfriend was then declared missing.  She has been acting extremely strange lately, and I suppose it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out. People have been saying she killed him, kidnapped him, all sorts of things. I hope you can find the truth and clear her name because I know Claire isn't a murderer.

Report: Nina Martin, a good family friend of mine, is in college. She recently came back for her break, and she brought back all her stuff as well. Her little cousin is 12 years old and borrowed her USB stick that she brought back to use in a school project. To his horror, there were "photos of dead bodies in a room," and he came and told me after stressing out about it for three days. I haven't seen the photos so I can't be sure of it myself, because her cousin gave it back to her already. To the best of my knowledge, she doesn't know that we know, and her cousin is genuinely scared shitless. Please help sort this out. I don't want her leaving again for college with this on my mind.

Report: Closing up at the club the other night I overheard one of the girls say she took a guy to some after-party at the motel down the road and stole his shit when he was passed out. It's not out of the ordinary to get off work and head to an after-party and see someone who was at the club that night, but to rob them when they're passed out is so petty. Initially I thought she was just making things up about the stealing, but some of the regulars have been saying they've heard the same. Before I went to the owner of the club, Jax, and told him what I thought was going on, I wanted to ask Yumi. I brought it up as casually as I could and she assured me that it was just a joke and there was nothing to worry about. I know driving away our customers by robbing them wouldn't make sense in the long run, considering it's only a couple extra bucks for yourself and you risk getting arrested. However, I wouldn't put it past some of the girls to do something stupid. If I'm wrong about this and I call out Yumi I'll lose my job. I have a kid to feed and bills to pay, so if y'all could look into this I'd appreciate it. Also if you're around, stop by VIL Dance Club and ask for Kimmy, that's me.

Report: I saw a woman who appeared to be luring a kid into a white van. An older man was driving it. When I went over to investigate further, she started stuttering like she was on crack or something, and tried to get this kid inside the vehicle as fast as possible. I managed to talk to her, but she said she had to get going because her kid was late for soccer practice. They sped off pretty quickly, so I just assumed that the woman was telling the truth. As I thought about it more, it started nagging at me. The kid seemed okay and not in any danger, but you can never be too careful these days.

Report: Roy sets up a bi-annual Scare-A-Thon for the community. He uses an old projector to screen a bunch of classic horror movies in his backyard for the entire neighborhood. The whole thing is a blast, everyone from the kids to the adults love when the time comes around for another one. If that wasn't enough Roy even sets the scene with his props and decorations in the entrance you have to pass through. This past one left me questioning some of the decorations Roy put up. Now I have to mention pretty much everyone is friendly with him, hell we've even had him over for a BBQ once or twice. Since that last Scare-A-Thon I've been questioning myself long enough and wanted to report this here in case there is actually anything malicious happening. See Roy being the hardcore horror movie aficionado he is, some of the photos he puts up look almost too good, like they could be real. He recreates some of his favorite scenes in the off time between Scare-A-Thons and prints out the photos to use as decorations and they're damn convincing. Now him holding horror movies clearly close to his heart, I can see how he would try to go the extra mile with these things. The blood, decapitated bodies, dismembered limbs, you name it, there's probably a picture of Roy with these things. Shit I hope I'm wrong here and he's just some computer wiz who knows how to edit a photo really well. I couldn't stand to find out we've been hanging around with some psycho all this time.

Report: I've been down in the dumps for the past couple months after finding out the woman who I thought I was going to marry was instead catfishing me for cash and various gifts the whole time. With friends and family worried about my well-being for the foreseeable future, they were all looking for ways to cheer me up and fix the situation. One friend found this unique service called The Fishermen. He gave me a quick rundown, that they were private investigators who would find the people who catfished you and help to get you closure. I thought it was a joke at first, but then he said I had a meeting with one of the guys and regardless if I wanted their help or not I had to attend. Weird, but going through the motions I went downtown and met 'the fisherman' who would be helping me with my situation. I begrudgingly had to recount the past events that I kept shelled up inside for months before this moment. After which the man almost seemed pleased, like I fulfilled his criteria. My buddy had already forwarded all the information we knew about the person who catfished me. So the only thing I had to do was sign a piece of paper saying that the information I provided was correct. After signing what was essentially a contract, I asked, "How will finding the person who did this help me?" The man with a smug face said, "We'll do more than just find them. Don't worry you're in good hands." We left the meeting at that point, and my friend encouraged me that this was the best move going forward. Without a real answer to my question, I can't be sure what I agreed to. From everyone trying their best to do right by me, I want to believe that this is some niche prank service to get back at shitty people. When I went home I tried to look The Fishermen up and found nothing online. I have no clue how my buddy found them and I just want to know for sure nothing malicious is going to happen.
